# Project Plan: Offline-First Educational Web Application

## Project Goal
To design and build a **lightweight, offline-first web application** that enables students in rural schools with low or unreliable internet connectivity to access learning materials without disruption.

---

## Problem Overview
Many digital learning platforms fail in rural areas due to slow or inconsistent internet. This limits students’ access to educational resources and increases the learning gap.

---

## Proposed Solution
We will build a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that works offline by default. Learning content such as lessons and quizzes will be stored locally on the device and synced only when internet connectivity is available. This ensures continuous learning even in low-bandwidth environments.

---

## Key Features
- Offline-accessible lessons (text and images)
- Offline quizzes and practice questions
- Local progress tracking
- Installable PWA support
- Manual data sync when internet is available

---

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** Next.js, HTML, CSS  
- **Offline Support:** Service Workers, IndexedDB / localStorage  
- **Backend (Optional):** Node.js, Express  
- **Deployment:** Netlify/Vercel (frontend), Render (backend)

---
